# Hacktoberfest 2024: Computer Vision Models & Datasets

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest 2024 Computer Vision repository! This project is designed to foster collaboration by sharing datasets, pre-trained models, and tools focused on computer vision tasks. Whether you're new to the field or an expert, your contributions are welcome. Let's build a rich resource for the computer vision community!

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for:
- 📊 **Datasets**: Upload or link datasets used for computer vision tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc.).
- 🤖 **Models**: Contribute pre-trained models or code for training models on various datasets.
- 📈 **Code & Scripts**: Share scripts, tools, and Jupyter notebooks to work with datasets and models.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the form of:
1. **Datasets**: Upload a dataset to the `/datasets` directory, or provide a link to an external dataset.
2. **Models**: Share your pre-trained models or training scripts in the `/models` directory. Include any relevant instructions or metadata.
3. **Scripts/Notebooks**: Submit Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to work with the datasets or models.
